abstract = "A large data set consisting of about 1000 normal mode periods, 500 summary travel time observations, 100 normal mode Q values, mass and moment of inertia have been inverted to obtain the radial distribution of elastic properties, Q values and density in the Earth's interior. The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2–4%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented."

The project, funded by the UK Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC), began in September 2001 and completed its first phase 3 years later. GridPP is a collaboration of approximately 100 researchers in 19 UK university particle physics groups, the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils and CERN, reflecting the strategic importance of the project. In collaboration with other European and US efforts, the first phase of the project demonstrated the feasibility of developing, deploying and operating a Grid-based computing system to meet the UK needs of the Large Hadron Collider experiments.

We compare the results from the new models with the predictions of a series of models that use OPAL radiative opacities, older determinations of the surface heavy-element abundances, and refinements of nuclear reaction rates. For all the variations we consider, solar models that are constructed with the newer and lower heavy-element abundances advocated by Asplund et al. disagree by much more than the estimated measuring errors with the helioseismological determinations of the depth of the solar convective zone, the surface helium composition, the internal sound speeds, and the density profile. Using the new OP radiative opacities, the ratio of the 8 B neutrino flux calculated with the older and larger heavy-element abundances (or with the newer and lower heavy-element abundances) to the total neutrino flux measured by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is 1.09 (0.87) with a 9% experimental uncertainty and a 16% theoretical uncertainty, 1 σ errors.}

  abstract={The Homestake Solar Neutrino Detector, based on the inverse beta-decay reaction ν e + 37 Cl → 37 Ar + e - , has been measuring the flux of solar neutrinos since 1970. The experiment has operated in a stable manner throughout this time period. All aspects of this detector are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the determination of the extraction and counting efficiencies, the key experimental parameters that are necessary to convert the measured 37 Ar count rate to the solar neutrino production rate. A thorough consideration is also given to the systematics of the detector, including the measurement of the extraction and counting efficiencies and the nonsolar production of 37 Ar. The combined result of 108 extractions is a solar neutrino-induced 37 Ar production rate of 2.56 ± 0.l6 (statistical) ± 0.16 (systematic) SNU.}

The result for GNO III (last 15 solar runs) is [54.3−9.3+9.9(stat)±2.3(syst)]SNU(1σ) or [54.3−9.6+10.2(incl. syst)] SNU (1σ) with errors combined. The GNO experiment is now terminated after altogether 58 solar exposure runs that were performed between 20 May 1998 and 9 April 2003. The combined result for GNO (I+II+III) is [62.9−5.3+5.5(stat)±2.5(syst)] SNU (1σ) or [62.9−5.9+6.0] SNU (1σ) with errors combined in quadrature. Overall, gallium based solar observations at LNGS (first in GALLEX, later in GNO) lasted from 14 May 1991 through 9 April 2003. The joint result from 123 runs in GNO and GALLEX is [69.3±5.5(incl. syst)] SNU (1σ). The distribution of the individual run results is consistent with the hypothesis of a neutrino flux that is constant in time. Implications from the data in particle- and astrophysics are reiterated."

abstract = "Combined analysis of the data of 92 runs of SAGE during the 12-year period January 1990 through December 2001 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of 70.9−5.2+5.3 (stat.) −3.2+3.7 (syst.) SNU. This represents only 55% of the predicted standard solar model rate of ∼130 SNU. The results of individual runs as well as the results of combined analysis of all runs during yearly, monthly, and bimonthly periods are presented. No compelling evidence for temporal variations is observed. By an analysis of the SAGE results combined with those from all other solar neutrino experiments, we make the first estimate of the electron neutrino pp flux that reaches the Earth to be (4.6 ± 1.2) x 1010/(cm2 s). Assuming that neutrinos oscillate to active flavors the pp neutrino flux emitted in the solar fusion reaction is approximately (7.6 ± 2.0) x 1010/(cm2 s), in agreement with the standard solar model calculation of (5.95 ± 0.06) x 1010/(cm2 s)."

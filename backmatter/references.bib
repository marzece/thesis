abstract = "A large data set consisting of about 1000 normal mode periods, 500 summary travel time observations, 100 normal mode Q values, mass and moment of inertia have been inverted to obtain the radial distribution of elastic properties, Q values and density in the Earth's interior. The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of ISC phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2–4%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model, PREM, and auxiliary tables showing fits to the data are presented."

  abstract={We construct solar models with the newly calculated radiative opacities from the Opacity Project (OP) and with recently determined (lower) heavy-element abundances. We compare the results from the new models with the predictions of a series of models that use OPAL radiative opacities, older determinations of the surface heavy-element abundances, and refinements of nuclear reaction rates. For all the variations we consider, solar models that are constructed with the newer and lower heavy-element abundances advocated by Asplund et al. disagree by much more than the estimated measuring errors with the helioseismological determinations of the depth of the solar convective zone, the surface helium composition, the internal sound speeds, and the density profile. Using the new OP radiative opacities, the ratio of the 8 B neutrino flux calculated with the older and larger heavy-element abundances (or with the newer and lower heavy-element abundances) to the total neutrino flux measured by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is 1.09 (0.87) with a 9% experimental uncertainty and a 16% theoretical uncertainty, 1 σ errors.}

The GNO experiment is now terminated after altogether 58 solar exposure runs that were performed between 20 May 1998 and 9 April 2003. The combined result for GNO (I+II+III) is [62.9−5.3+5.5(stat)±2.5(syst)] SNU (1σ) or [62.9−5.9+6.0] SNU (1σ) with errors combined in quadrature. Overall, gallium based solar observations at LNGS (first in GALLEX, later in GNO) lasted from 14 May 1991 through 9 April 2003. The joint result from 123 runs in GNO and GALLEX is [69.3±5.5(incl. syst)] SNU (1σ). The distribution of the individual run results is consistent with the hypothesis of a neutrino flux that is constant in time. Implications from the data in particle- and astrophysics are reiterated."

SNU. This represents only 55% of the predicted standard solar model rate of ∼130 SNU. The results of individual runs as well as the results of combined analysis of all runs during yearly, monthly, and bimonthly periods are presented. No compelling evidence for temporal variations is observed. By an analysis of the SAGE results combined with those from all other solar neutrino experiments, we make the first estimate of the electron neutrino pp flux that reaches the Earth to be (4.6 ± 1.2) x 1010/(cm2 s). Assuming that neutrinos oscillate to active flavors the pp neutrino flux emitted in the solar fusion reaction is approximately (7.6 ± 2.0) x 1010/(cm2 s), in agreement with the standard solar model calculation of (5.95 ± 0.06) x 1010/(cm2 s)."

abstract = "We report on the final electroweak measurements performed with data taken at the Z resonance by the experiments operating at the electron–positron colliders SLC and LEP. The data consist of 17 million Z decays accumulated by the ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL experiments at LEP, and 600 thousand Z decays by the SLD experiment using a polarised beam at SLC. The measurements include cross-sections, forward–backward asymmetries and polarised asymmetries. The mass and width of the Z boson, mZ and ΓZ, and its couplings to fermions, for example the ρ parameter and the effective electroweak mixing angle for leptons, are precisely measured:mZ=91.1875±0.0021GeV,ΓZ=2.4952±0.0023GeV,ρℓ=1.0050±0.0010,sin2θefflept=0.23153±0.00016.The number of light neutrino species is determined to be 2.9840±0.0082, in agreement with the three observed generations of fundamental fermions. The results are compared to the predictions of the Standard Model (SM). At the Z-pole, electroweak radiative corrections beyond the running of the QED and QCD coupling constants are observed with a significance of five standard deviations, and in agreement with the Standard Model. Of the many Z-pole measurements, the forward–backward asymmetry in b-quark production shows the largest difference with respect to its SM expectation, at the level of 2.8 standard deviations. Through radiative corrections evaluated in the framework of the Standard Model, the Z-pole data are also used to predict the mass of the top quark, mt=173-10+13GeV, and the mass of the W boson, mW=80.363±0.032GeV. These indirect constraints are compared to the direct measurements, providing a stringent test of the SM. Using in addition the direct measurements of mt and mW, the mass of the as yet unobserved SM Higgs boson is predicted with a relative uncertainty of about 50% and found to be less than 285GeV at 95% confidence level."

It is also shown that in a charged–current weak interaction process it is not possible to create a coherent superposition of different flavor neutrinos which is independent of the associated charged leptons."

We use helioseismology to constrain the luminosity evolution of the Sun and report the discovery of semiconvection in evolved solar models that include diffusion. In addition, we compare the computed sound speeds with the results of p-mode observations by BiSON, GOLF, GONG, LOWL, and MDI instruments. We contrast the neutrino predictions from a set of eight standard-like solar models and four deviant (or deficient) solar models with the results of solar neutrino experiments. For solar neutrino and helioseismological applications, we present present-epoch numerical tabulations of characteristics of the standard solar model as a function of solar radius, including the principal physical and composition variables, sound speeds, neutrino fluxes, and functions needed for calculating solar neutrino oscillations.}

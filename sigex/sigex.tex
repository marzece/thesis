This section details the analysis methods used for extracting the $\ce{^{8}B}$
interaction rate in the SNO+ detector during it's initial water-phase
data taking run.
SNO+ is sensitive to the $\ce{^{8}B}$ and $hep$ solar neutrinos,
though at almost all energies the interaction rate of $\ce{^{8}B}$ neutrinos
is dominant over the rate of $hep$ neutrino interactions.
Lower energy solar neutrinos, such as those from the $pep$ and $\ce{^{7}Be}$
reactions are in principle measurable, but radioactive backgrounds from
contaminants in the water render signal extraction nearly impossible.




Solar neutrino events are monte-carlo simulated using ``RAT'', a Geant-4 based
simulation and analysis toolkit.
RAT simulates all effects after the initial interaction, including photon
propagation and detection, and particle scattering.
Beyond the photon and physics simulation RAT also simulates the SNO+ DAQ and trigger electronics,
allowing the effects of digitization and electronics noise to be simulated.

A solar neutrino production rate is an input to the simulation.
A cross-section model take from \cite{bahcall} and \cite{lookitup}
is used to estimate the elastic scattering interaction rate.
RAT provides an accurate model of the detector response for each interaction.

Solar neutrino events are simulated on run-by-run basis with a fixed average rate
of interactions.
Each run's simulation is matched to the detector trigger and
DAQ settings for that run.
To ensure adequate monte-carlo statistics the rate of solar $\nu_{e}$ and
$\nu_{\mu\text{,\,}tau}$ interactions are respectively enhanced by a factor of
1700 and 9600;
the enhanced rate is later removed as a correction
to the normalization of the PDFs created from the monte-carlo simulation.

$\theta_{sun}$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
\cos\theta_{sun} = \vec{d}\cdot\vec{d_{sun}}\text{, }
\end{equation}
where $\vec{d_{e}}$ represents the reconstructed direction of an event and
$\vec{d_{sun}}$ is the direction vector pointing from the center of the sun to
the reconstructed position of the event.
$\vec{d_{sun}}$ estimates the direction the neutrino was travelling when it interacted
within the detector, $\vec{d_{\nu}}$; it is assumed the neutrino travelled directly
from the center of the sun without scattering off anything while it travelled.
This is a good assumption because the neutrino cross-section is small that it's very
unlikely the neutrino will interact with anything before interacting in the detector.
Assuming the neutrino comes from the center of the sun is a poor assumption for an individual
neutrino, but averaged over many neutrinos it is a good assumption.
Additionally, correcting for the radius the neutrino is produced at would only adjust
the direction by at most $0.1\deg$.
Figure XXX shows the angle between $d_{sun}$ and $d_{\nu}$ for simulated solar neutrino
events.

Figure XXX shows why $\theta_{sun}$ is a useful variable for a solar neutrino analysis.
By comparing the rates of events with different values for $\theta_{sun}$ one can
extract a background rate and a solar rate.

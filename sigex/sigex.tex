 Described here is the analysis used for extracting the $\ce{^{8}B}$ solar
 neutrino flux and interaction rate in the SNO+ detector during its initial
 water-phase data taking run.
This first section provides a broad overview of the data, simulation and analysis methods
used for this result.
A more detailed description of these topics is provided in the following sections.
A report of these results is also published in Anderson~\textit{et.\ al.}~\cite{snop_solar}.

Neutrinos interact in the SNO+ detector by elastic scattering off
electrons in the detector volume.
Depending on the energy transferred in the interaction
the scattered electron will produce Cherenkov radiation, which is detected by the PMT array.
The direction of the Cherenkov cone is expected to be pointing directly away
from the Sun at the time of the event for solar neutrino interactions.
The principle of this analysis is to search for the rate of events that exhibit
this solar direction correlation, and interpret that rate as a solar neutrino flux.
This analysis is similar to solar neutrino measurements done by SuperK~\cite{superk4} and, SNO~\cite{sno_combined}.

Data for this analysis was taken from May 2017 to January 2018, with pauses
for maintenance, calibration, and commissioning of detector components.
The majority of data taken was blinded for an eventual search for invisible
nucleon decay~\cite{snop_nd}.
A two week period of time at the start of data taking was left un-blinded to
allow for analysis methods to be evaluated, this period of time is referred
to as the open dataset.
Approximately half-way through the data taking period the detector trigger thresholds
were adjusted, allowing for a significant reduction in the detector energy
threshold.
The periods of time before and after this threshold reduction are respectively
referred to as the high and low threshold period.
And finally, during the commissioning of the external water circulation system
a significant increase in radioactive backgrounds was observed in the upper
portion of the external water.
These background rates eventually returned to normal levels; the period of time
during which the rate of external backgrounds were elevated is referred to
as the ``hot-spot'' time period, as the backgrounds were clustered around
a small area of the detector.

Simulation is used to determine expected event rates and distributions of
detector observables for SNO+.
The simulation software used is ``RAT'', which performs Monte Carlo
simulation of events within the SNO+ detector.
Beyond simulation RAT also provides methods for reconstructing event
observables, \textit{e.g.} energy, direction etc.
And so RAT is also used for processing detector data in addition
to simulated data.
There exists a open-source version of this software called
RAT-PAC~\cite{ratpac} that is largely the same as the SNO+ version of RAT,
the most significant difference is the implementations of a detector model
and event reconstruction methods.

The $\ce{^{8}B}$ solar neutrino signal is extracted from the detector dataset
using a number of cuts to isolate likely solar neutrino events, and remove
background events.
Two broad categories of cuts exist, data cleaning and analysis cuts.
Data cleaning aims to remove events that originate from instrumental effects using
low-level criteria, such as the distribution of charge across the hit PMTS\@.
Analysis cuts are designed to select the events originating from the physics of
interest, in this case $\ce{^{8}B}$ solar neutrino events.
The analysis cuts make use of reconstructed information, such as event energy
or position.

A fit is performed to the dataset after cuts, searching for the rate above background of events
that are directed away from the Sun as the time of the event.
The source of these events is assumed to be $\ce{^{8}B}$ solar neutrinos, and
so the flux $\ce{^{8}B}$ events is estimated from the observed event rate.
Simulation is used to produce the PDFs used in the fit and provide a map observed
event rate to neutrino flux.
Since simulation plays a significant role in this analysis, data taken using
a deployed $\ce{^{16}N}$ source is used to evaluate the accuracy of the
simulation, assign systematic uncertainties to distributions of simulated observables
and similarly provide empirical corrections to those observables.

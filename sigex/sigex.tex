\section{Signal Extraction}
Solar neutrino events are simulated using ``RAT'', a Geant-4 based
simulation and analysis toolkit.
RAT simulates all effects after the initial interaction, including photon
propagation and detection, and particle scattering.
Beyond the photon and physics simulation RAT also simluates the SNO+ DAQ and trigger electronics,
allowing the effects of digitization and electronics noise to be simulated.

A solar neutrino production rate is an input to the simulation.
A cross-section model take from \cite{bahcall} and \cite{lookitup}
is used to estimate the elastic scattering interaction rate.
RAT provides an accurate model of the detector response for each interaction.

Solar neutrino simulation is done on run-by-run basis with a fixed, artificially
enhanced, rate. Each run's simulation is matched to the detector trigger and
daq settings for that run.

The simlated events are histogrammed to estimate the underlying PDFs
of observable reconstructed energy and event direction. Cut's are placed
on each event to

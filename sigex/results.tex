Figure~\ref{fig:costheta} shows the distribution of events in $\cos\theta_\text{{sun}}$
for events over the entire energy range of $5$ to $15$\,MeV and the fit to that distribution.\
The fit gives a solar event rate of $1.30\pm0.18$~events/kt-day
 and background rate of  $10.23\pm0.38$~events/kt-day.
Performing a similar fit in each individual energy bin yielded a best fit solar flux
as a function of energy.\
The fits were combined, in accordance with Eq.~\ref{eq:ll}, yielding an overall best fit flux of
\begin{equation*}
    \Phi_{ES}= 2.53^{+0.31}_{-0.28}\text{(stat.)}^{+0.13}_{-0.10}\text{(syst.)}\times10^6\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This value assumes the neutrino flux consists purely of electron flavor neutrinos.\
The result agrees with the elastic scattering flux published by Super-K,
$\Phi_{ES}=\left(2.345\pm0.039\right)\times10^{6}cm^{-2}s^{-1}$~\cite{superk4},
combining statistical and systematic errors.\

Including the effects of solar neutrino oscillations, using the neutrino mixing
parameters given in Ref.~\cite{pdg2016} and the solar production and electron
density distributions given in Ref.~\cite{bs05op} gave a best fit solar flux
of
\begin{equation*}
    \Phi_{\ce{^{8}B}}= 5.95^{+0.75}_{-0.71}\text{(stat.)}^{+0.28}_{-0.30}\text{(syst.)}\times10^{6}\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This result is consistent with the $\ce{^{8}B}$ flux as measured by the SNO experiment,
$\Phi_{\ce{^{8}B}}=\left(5.25\pm0.20\right)\times10^{6}cm^{-2}s^{1}$~\cite{sno_combined}, combining statistical
and systematic uncertainties.\
Figure~\ref{spectrum} shows the best fit solar neutrino $\ce{^{8}B}$ event rate in each
energy bin along with the predicted energy spectrum scaled to the best fit
flux, and scaled to the flux measured by SNO\@. Each statistical error bar on the
measured rate is affected by both the solar neutrino and background rates in that
energy bin.\
Table~\ref{table:systematics} details how each systematic uncertainty affects this result.\

\end{figure}

The upper five energy bins, \numrange[range-phrase=--]{6.0}{15.0}\,MeV, were an
extremely low background region for this analysis.\
There was very little background contamination from
cosmogenically produced isotopes due primarily to depth of the detector.\
The comparatively high rate of backgrounds in the \numrange[range-phrase=--]{5.0}{6.0}\,MeV bin
comes primarily from decays of radioactive isotopes, such as radon, within the detector.\
Figure~\ref{fig:cos_theta_six} shows the distribution in $\cos\theta_\text{{sun}}$ of events at
energies above 6~MeV, illustrating the low background rate.\
In that energy region the best fit background rate was $0.25^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$\,events/kt-day, much
lower than the measured solar rate in that energy range,$1.03^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$\,events/kt-day.
For the region above 6~MeV, this is the lowest
background elastic scattering measurement of solar neutrinos in a water
Cherenkov detector.\

\subsection{Mixing Results}
By using the SNO $\ce{^{8}B}$ flux result as the true value for the full,
flavor independent, $\ce{^{8}B}$ solar neutrino flux, this measurement of the
solar elastic-scattering rate can be used to the effective solar neutrino survival
probability.
This sort of measurement has been done before, most significantly by
Super Kamiokande~\cite{superk1,superk2,superk3,superk4}.
%and also by Borexino???TODO check if borexino has doen this

For any combination of electron recoil energy $T_{\mathrm{e}}$ and solar
neutrino energy, $E_{\nu}$ the relation between the survival probability
and the elastic scattering rate is........

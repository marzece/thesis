% Thesis Acknowledgements ------------------------------------------------

\begin{acknowledgements}
  This thesis, as a representation of the knowledge and understanding I've managed to acquire
 over my time at Penn, is only possible because of the support provided
  to me by my fellow Penn students, office mates, and advisors.
  Particular thanks is owed to Josh Klein, it's tough to say how
  Josh could have been a better advisor, it'd probably start with fewer
  mentions of the AMB though.

  I owe Andy Mastbaum a great deal, he was a well of knowledge and experience for me
  when my own understanding proved shallow.
  Much of my work was done with Tanner Kaptanoglu providing input

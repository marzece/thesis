Add results and figures for kamland
Add results and figures for SNO
Add results and figures for SuperK
Add results and figures for Borexino
Add dscription of radio-chemical experiments + results

Find NSI paper and get equation for modified potential
(and description). And figures

Give solar production and density profile sources and figures
Need number of energy and radii samples in simulation

Talk a little bit about front-end calibration [ECA/ECALs]

For a 10 MeV neutrino at wat matter density is the
resonane and at that radius

Also what is the maximum electron density within the sun?
And below what energy will a neutrino never experience an
MSW resonance?

Need a paragraph or so about the wave packet treatement
